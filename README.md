# Haerwu

Haerwu is a theme for the Pelican static site generator. Inspired by
[Spacious](https://themegrill.com/themes/spacious/) theme for WordPress.

I use this theme on my [personal
blog](https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/).

## Plugins

There is support for several plugins:

- neighbors

There are several items in theme which should be more configurable. Going
through them in spare time.

Current options:
